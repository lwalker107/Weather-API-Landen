# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

Weather Application that uses 3rd Party API Openweather to
get real-time data for whatever city the user inputs into 
the search bar. Data includes temperature, wind speed, humidity, date, name and an icon that represents the weather. Uses localStorage to keep the data from previous searches persistent on the web app and includes a clear button to clear the local storage also.

## Tutor Help
I received help from a tutor for parts of the Javascript dealing with Lines 10-29 that show how to display the information on the page and grabbing the specific info from the API. Also on lines 78-84 on how to create an effective clear button to clear the local storage. AskBCS was also used to help figure out how to position the "weather dashboard" in the style.css.
